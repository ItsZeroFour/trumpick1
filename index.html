You can independently modify the products containing important compounds for health and youth according to your preferences. These can be various groups of products, even in opposing price and category ranges.</p><p>TrumPick analytics for major world regions has shown that adhering to the project&apos;s recommendations is comparable to expenses with a standard diet. Typically, in each region of the world, including those in northern latitudes, there is an inexpensive category of products that meet the criteria of balanced nutrition</p></div></li><li><div class="main__faq-top"><h3>Compiled my actual menu. Why do I have a low onset age of aging?</h3><button class="toggle-btn"><img src="./assets/icons/plus.svg" alt="show"></button></div><div class="main__faq-main"><p>Often, we misunderstand the term &apos;balanced nutrition.&apos; Most people genuinely try to adhere to dietary principles that they believe are correct.</p><p>However, current nutrition science, based on peer-reviewed articles, academic literature, human physiology, chemistry, and sociology, has formulated fundamental principles and approaches related to real criteria for balanced nutrition. These may differ from what an individual, including a scientist, doctor, author of popular books, and so on, may think about nutrition.</p><p>For this reason, you might see an evaluation that differs from what you expected.</p><p>TrumPick&apos;s main goal is to help you improve your health and preserve youthfulness. You will see these results through medical tests and subjective well-being. However, it&apos;s essential to be ready for a change in your daily diet. Initially, it might seem challenging. However, on days 20-60, when you observe clear positive results and get used to the new dietary style, it will become easy.</p><p>Balanced nutrition, as TrumPick suggests, consists of various ingredients and food groups that can be part of very delicious dishes. The main thing is your sincere and real desire to change your health and appearance for the better, not just pretending to make changes. In reality, it&apos;s a small effort leading to tremendous positive results.</p><p>If, for social, cultural, or personal reasons, or due to a strong belief in certain arguments, you find it challenging to adhere to rational principles, you can use TrumPick &apos;for information&apos; and situational application, meaning only executing those recommendations that personally suit you. This will also improve your well-being and reduce the risks of chronic diseases, even if not as significantly as following most of TrumPick&apos;s tips</p></div></li><li><div class="main__faq-top"><h3>I have bad genetics and high disease risks. Can nutrition help me?</h3><button class="toggle-btn"><img src="./assets/icons/plus.svg" alt="show"></button></div><div class="main__faq-main"><p>Yes, proper nutrition can play a crucial role in managing disease risks, even with the overwhelming majority of genetic predispositions. Although genetics can influence your susceptibility to some diseases, the principles of balanced nutrition generally play a decisive role, with few exceptions. This is true even for many active chronic diseases, often reported as having genetic foundations, which can be brought into remission.</p><p>For instance, most cardiovascular diseases, including atherosclerosis (&apos;cholesterol plaques&apos;), erectile dysfunction, type 2 diabetes, hypertension, constipation, many types of cancer, and more, can be entirely preventable through nutrition. These diseases are the main causes of premature death, reduced comfort, and quality of life, and they consume significant resources for treatment.</p><p>Compounds present in food either stimulate the action of genes leading to diseases or suppress them, preventing the onset of these diseases.</p><p>Moreover, many diseases attributed to predominant genetic factors may not be truly genetic. They are often linked to dietary and lifestyle habits passed down from parents and grandparents, as well as prevailing habits in the society you live in. Changing behavior or being in the company of people with healthier habits can radically improve health, and diseases with presumed genetic predispositions may not develop.</p><p>You can try using TrumPick and see how your test results and well-being change after a couple of months. TrumPick recommendations are designed not to harm you. If you don&apos;t see a clear and distinct result, you can simply return to your old habits and only adopt what you like from TrumPick&apos;s advice.</p><p>In essence, if you are skeptical about the power of nutrition, start using TrumPick as an opportunity to try something new without additional investments. If this experience proves enjoyable over 2-3 months, you can incorporate it into your life</p></div></li><li><div class="main__faq-top"><h3>How likely is it that following TrumPick&apos;s advice will help me improve my health and slow down aging?</h3><button class="toggle-btn"><img src="./assets/icons/plus.svg" alt="show"></button></div><div class="main__faq-main"><p>TrumPick recommendations are structured in a way that their implementation cannot cause any harm, both in the long term and during the moment of execution.</p><p>Effectiveness depends on how closely you follow the advice. If you adhere to each of the following points for more than 2-3 months, the likelihood of preventing and remission of diseases is assessed to be extremely high, and for most conditions, the probability is above 95%: accurately choose a regimen suitable for your situation; at least 80% of the products in the &quot;Menu&quot; section are in the green zone, and no more than 5% are in the red zone; the percentage content is more than 80% of the daily required compounds for more than 2-3 months; you roughly adhere to the quantity of products necessary to achieve the effect</p></div></li><li><div class="main__faq-top"><h3>Is following the dietary advice provided by TrumPick a substitute for the treatment prescribed by a doctor?</h3><button class="toggle-btn"><img src="./assets/icons/plus.svg" alt="show"></button></div><div class="main__faq-main"><p>No, you should strictly adhere to the doctor&apos;s recommendations if they are prescribed within the treatment protocols. If you suspect that the doctor is making a mistake or doing something wrong, it is advisable to seek a second medical opinion or seek clarification from your insurance company if they cover medical expenses.</p><p>Balanced nutrition provides the body with compounds needed for the immune system to prevent and combat diseases. Therefore, nutrition is a significant factor for significantly reducing the risks of both infectious and chronic diseases, reducing their duration and severity, as well as alleviating symptoms and preventing the most serious consequences of untreatable diseases.</p><p>In other words, professional medical assistance based on evidence-based medicine principles and balanced nutrition, as informed by TrumPick, complement each other. One does not replace the other. Typically, if you follow the advice of balanced nutrition before the onset of chronic diseases and over an extended period, you have a low risk of all diseases, and medical intervention may not be required in such cases.</p></div></li><li><div class="main__faq-top"><h3>It is stated that TrumPick is in the beta testing stage.

That is, a detailed public report on the incoming funds will be provided so that everyone can assess the presence of any vested interests.</p><p>TrumPick&apos;s policy does not involve interaction with any brands, as the assessment is based on the evaluation of ingredients used and the impact of products based on their chemical composition. In other words, to provide a positive or negative assessment, it would be necessary to modify the list of ingredients used in the product&apos;s preparation.</p></div></li><li><div class="main__faq-top"><h3>How are food products rated?</h3><button class="toggle-btn"><img src="./assets/icons/plus.svg" alt="show"></button></div><div class="main__faq-main"><p>For any data about the impact of products on health and youth, these data must simultaneously meet three or more of the following criteria.</p><p>Firstly, there must be a statistical correlation between the consumption of products and the development of certain diseases, including a correlation that has been repeatedly confirmed and is a stable association.</p><p>Secondly, an assessment of products from peer-reviewed scientific journals. Typically, materials evaluated are those whose production was not funded by food manufacturers, and the authors of articles and the editors of journals where the article is published should not have explicit connections with such producers. Special attention is given to the adequacy of the evaluation method applied to the described data.</p><p>Thirdly, information about the mechanism of development and the impact on diseases of the products and their individual components, contained in current academic literature. That is, books used for the training of professionals in the fields of medicine, chemistry, biology, statistics, and other areas directly or indirectly related to nutrition. Fourthly, the collection of observations from doctors and cosmetologists about the impact of certain types of diets or individual products on the course of diseases and the indicators of analyses. This helps promptly detect the peculiarities of the impact of certain products under specific conditions. Fifthly, the analysis of the dietary habits of the longest-living people in the world.</p><p>Typically, this is done based on information from scientific journals, descriptions of lifestyle in books, and notes published by specialized journalists and researchers, as well as the accounts of people who have lived in those areas for a long time. Sixthly, data from insurance companies, i.e., how much the costs of treating diseases fall on patients adhering to one or another type of diet.</p><p>Additionally, recommendations typically exclude data whose application is associated with additional risks, i.e., there is an objective risk that the use of these data may worsen people&apos;s health conditions.</p></div></li><li><div class="main__faq-top"><h3>TrumPick evaluates products without ingredient labels, such as vegetables or fruits?</h3><button class="toggle-btn"><img src="./assets/icons/plus.svg" alt="show"></button></div><div class="main__faq-main"><p>Yes, certainly. You can type the name of the product or take a photo of the price tag with its name.</p><p>TrumPick will provide information about the content of vitamins, minerals, dietary fiber, antioxidants in the product, as well as data on the product&apos;s impact on increasing or decreasing the risks of diseases, its presence in the diet of long-lived individuals. It will also suggest tasty combinations with other products and recipes where the product can be used in a significant amount, i.e., an amount closely associated with reducing the risk of developing diseases.</p></div></li><li><div class="main__faq-top"><h3>Does TrumPick take into account the geography of cultivation or harvesting of whole foods?</h3><button class="toggle-btn"><img src="./assets/icons/plus.svg" alt="show"></button></div><div class="main__faq-main"><p>Likely, this question is related to the fact that whole foods, such as vegetables, fruits, fish, etc., may have an &apos;organic&apos; status, which differs in the profile of vitamins, minerals, etc.</p><p>Indeed, products can vary in the content of specific compounds depending on geography and cultivation methods. Organic products generally have fewer harmful compounds on their surfaces.</p><p>However, to support growth, each product of a particular type has a set of similar compounds in its composition. That is, there are types and quantities of vitamins, minerals, antioxidants, dietary fiber, etc., without which the product cannot reach maturity and dies at an early stage when it is not suitable for consumption. Some products contain more of these compounds, while others contain less. Some products may have additional types of compounds. TrumPick provides information about components that are consistently present in significant amounts in the product, based on data from at least 10 or more regions where these products are cultivated or caught, whether through conventional methods, organic farming methods (aquaculture), or growing in the wild.</p><p>Thus, TrumPick&apos;s information about the composition of whole foods is a minimal set of compounds that have a significant impact on humans when consumed. Some products may contain more but not fewer useful compounds.</p><p>Vegetable products with an &apos;organic&apos; status generally have fewer fertilizers, including pesticides, on their surfaces. However, there are culinary methods for completely removing these fertilizers from the surface of the product, as indicated by TrumPick.</p></div></li><li><div class="main__faq-top"><h3>TrumPick take the quantity of food product into account?</h3><button class="toggle-btn"><img src="./assets/icons/plus.svg" alt="show"></button></div><div class="main__faq-main"><p>The quantity of the consumed product, as well as the frequency of its inclusion in the diet, is a crucial factor determining the impact of the product on the body. Similar to how the dose and adherence to the schedule determine the effectiveness of medication - the medicinal dose, the quantity and duration of including the product in the menu - its &apos;food dose&apos; - determines the influence of the corresponding food on the body.</p><p>Therefore, the effective or safe quantity of the product is a fundamental aspect communicated by TrumPick. On the &apos;Results&apos; page, i.e., after analyzing the product, on the &apos;Menu&apos; page, and in the tabs of the &apos;Ideal menu&apos; or &apos;Search&apos;, when clicking on a product, you can see the effective quantity of the product. This quantity may vary depending on the mode you have selected, i.e., based on your life situation.

In other words, is it necessary to consume a specific product day by day to achieve the desired effect.</p><p>It is necessary to include in the diet for an extended period the products recommended by TrumPick in the &apos;Ideal menu&apos; section on the &apos;Menu&apos; page for a specific mode. The products in the &apos;green zone&apos; should make up 90% of the total daily diet, and the overall percentage of the total compounds needed by the body should approach 100%.</p><p>In essence, the diversity of products linked to an adequate diet is important. Even the most beneficial product does not contain all the components necessary to support all bodily functions.</p><p>If the condition is met that at least 90% of the products on the &apos;Menu&apos; page belong to the &apos;green zone&apos; and the daily consumption of compounds is over 80%, then your diet aligns with the effective norm. If there is a need for additional inclusion of a specific group of products due to the presence of unique compounds that are known to provide additional benefits in your situation, TrumPick will provide additional information on this.</p><p>Therefore, the specified duration under the label &apos;When will you see results on selected mode&apos; is the duration of an overall adequate diet as communicated by TrumPick. There is no need to consume the same products every day; you can easily replace them with other nutritious items.

TrumPick contains sections that can be specifically important for individuals adhering to ethical norms.</p><p>For example, TrumPick displays ingredients that may be made using animal-derived products, specifying the source of the raw materials. Often, among such products, there are those that may not be immediately obvious. There is also a section that helps vegans and vegetarians exclude plant-based products that may have a particularly negative effect on their skin and health.</p><p>Thanks to TrumPick, strict vegans, vegans, vegetarians, and pescetarians can easily plan their menu that provides them with all the necessary compounds. The difficulty in planning a diet that meets all the needs of individuals adhering to ethical norms is indeed one of the key aspects highlighted in research.</p></div></li><li><div class="main__faq-top"><h3>How safe is it to use the advice provided by TrumPick?</h3><button class="toggle-btn"><img src="./assets/icons/plus.svg" alt="show"></button></div><div class="main__faq-main"><p>First, do no harm&quot; is indeed a fundamental principle, and TrumPick follows this approach. The tips provided do not include advice that could worsen your condition or increase justified risks.

How can TrumPick help me?</h3><button class="toggle-btn"><img src="./assets/icons/plus.svg" alt="show"></button></div><div class="main__faq-main"><p>TrumPick provides information about products that may have cross-reactions with other products and groups of non-food compounds. For instance, a person with an allergy to a specific compound, such as pollen from certain plants, may experience reactions when interacting with products that contain identical compounds to those found in the pollen. This information can help increase the comfort of individuals with allergies and shed light on discomfort and reactions related to specific products.</p><p>TrumPick also includes indications of products and cross-reactions associated with food sensitivity, intolerance to certain products, as well as histamine intolerance syndrome. If you experience allergies that are unclear or undiagnosed despite attempts, you can use the corresponding section in the app to investigate the reasons for discomfort with certain types of products. If you establish a relevant connection, be sure to inform your physician, as such reactions can sometimes indicate the development of a specific condition.</p><p>To prevent allergies, it is also tips to follow TrumPick&apos;s advice in the &apos;Breastfeeding and Introduction of Solid Foods&apos; and &apos;Healthy growth&apos; modes. The stage of introducing solid food and getting a child accustomed to it can play a crucial role in preventing allergies and ensuring a more comfortable life for the child, free from the consequences of allergic reactions.</p></div></li><li><div class="main__faq-top"><h3>I am pregnant. Can I use TrumPick, and will it help me in any way?</h3><button class="toggle-btn"><img src="./assets/icons/plus.svg" alt="show"></button></div><div class="main__faq-main"><p>The diet during pregnancy is not significantly different from a well-balanced diet suitable for everyday consumption. The only difference is that at certain stages of pregnancy, an additional amount of food is required because there are two of you. Additionally, it is often advisable to consume certain compounds from foods that are most associated with successful outcomes for pregnancy more frequently.</p><p>Choose the regimens that correspond to your pregnancy period (trimester) to receive recommendations applicable to a normal pregnancy not associated with difficult gestation.</p><p>If you are experiencing a complicated pregnancy or have had complications in previous pregnancies, such as gestational diabetes and preeclampsia, consider using a special regimen for problematic pregnancies. It includes additional advice and recommended dietary norms and restrictions, which can often help overcome difficulties. Moreover, it is advisable for prospective fathers and mothers in the planning stage of conception to use a special regimen that can help eliminate hidden deficiencies in certain compounds. Very often, this helps in successful conception when it has not occurred for a long time without identified reasons.</p><p>That is, following these recommendations will not lead to any restrictions or side effects but can be beneficial.</p></div></li><li><div class="main__faq-top"><h3>What does food have to do with Global warming?</h3><button class="toggle-btn"><img src="./assets/icons/plus.svg" alt="show"></button></div><div class="main__faq-main"><p>Global warming is an ongoing, long-term process of increasing temperatures on Earth. This creates favorable conditions for the emergence of global epidemics. As temperatures rise, bacteria, viruses, and fungi multiply more rapidly. Importantly, it increases their survivability at temperatures higher than that of the human body, making them more resistant to the body&apos;s immune response upon entry.</p><p>For instance, if fungi learn to survive at temperatures above 36&deg;C (97&deg;F), they could become deadly to humans without existing medications. Currently, these types of fungi do not pose a threat to humans as they are destroyed by the body&apos;s temperature. With the current pace of global warming, such survivability for fungi may be reached within the next 20-35 years.</p><p>The second issue associated with global warming is changes in the planet&apos;s water balance due to higher rates of evaporation of freshwater. As a result, soils lose fertility, and food becomes extremely expensive and less accessible.</p><p>Climate change occurs due to the Earth&apos;s temperature increase caused by the influence of greenhouse gases. The Earth absorbs sunlight and then radiates it as heat back into space. Greenhouse gases, including water vapor, carbon dioxide, methane, and ozone, are by-products of human and animal activities, including industrial and technological processes. These gases absorb the heat emitted by the Earth, slowing down its release into space. However, they do not impede the absorption of heat from a new batch of sunlight, leading to an overall increase in heat, and subsequently, a rise in Earth&apos;s temperature.</p><p>There is a well-defined statistical link between increased greenhouse gas emissions and the factors contributing to it. Generally, it is considered challenging to simultaneously slow down these emissions, given their connection to industries and transportation crucial for human quality of life. However, the food production sector, which is not essential for human well-being but increases the risk of diseases, is responsible for over 18% of greenhouse gas emissions.</p><p>For example, the production of such food involves deforestation. Forests play a role in converting certain greenhouse gases into oxygen and prevent water loss. Without deforestation, increasing the production of such food is almost impossible due to a global shortage of suitable land. The popularity of such products is driven by marketing, leading to an increased demand.</p><p>If more than 1/5 of the global population follows TrumPick&apos;s daily dietary recommendations, it will lead to the cessation of global warming. If more than 1/3 follows these recommendations within 5-6 years, the temperature will gradually return to an acceptable level within 30-40 years. This transformation can happen without compromising the quality of life and income for the majority of the population.</p><p>This is likely the optimal strategy for humanity since avoiding such products will lead to a significant reduction in the burden of chronic and infectious diseases and the cessation of global warming. Thus, your contribution to your own health is also your personal contribution to a beautiful and clean future for the Earth, free from the impacts of global warming due to sensible human actions.</p></div></li><li><div class="main__faq-top"><h3>On which devices can I use TrumPick?</h3><button class="toggle-btn"><img src="./assets/icons/plus.svg" alt="show"></button></div><div class="main__faq-main"><p>TrumPick is available on any phones, tablets, and computers, as well as internet-enabled TVs. Registering with the same email address synchronizes your data across all devices where such registration is done.

If you follow TrumPick recommendations for 2-3 months, and the daily intake of essential compounds on the &apos;Data&apos; or &apos;Menu&apos; page is around 100%, then a deficiency in compounds may only arise in relatively rare intestinal diseases or other organs, as well as extremely rare genetic conditions.</p><p>Due to the lack of scientifically and statistically substantiated data indicating a positive effect of dietary supplements on Healthspan &amp; Youthspan, and disease prevention, very few centenarians consume any of them. TrumPick does not provide any recommendations on the choice of dietary supplements. If such data become available, they will be promptly accessible in TrumPick since the app&apos;s information is constantly updated with data relevant to your health and youthfulness.</p><p>If you are certain that you need dietary supplements, it is advisable to seek advice from a physician who adheres to established treatment protocols and patient care. There are specific conditions and diseases where the use of dietary supplements is justified. However, the prescription of them should be based on a specific diagnosis, which is not determined by blood, hair analyses, etc., for vitamin and mineral deficiencies.</p><p>If you are pregnant or planning pregnancy, depending on your region, a doctor may also prescribe dietary supplements such as iodine, folic acid, vitamin D. Often, these compounds represent a deficiency in many places on the planet. Therefore, such a prescription of dietary supplements can also be justified at the planning stage of conception and during pregnancy, including without undergoing analyses for deficiencies in these compounds. It is advisable to continue balanced nutrition according to TrumPick tips for pregnant women, along with following your doctor&apos;s instructions for taking these supplements.</p></div></li><li><div class="main__faq-top"><h3>What about TrumPick&apos;s nose?</h3><button class="toggle-btn"><img src="./assets/icons/plus.svg" alt="show"></button></div><div class="main__faq-main"><p>Born this way</p></div></li><li><div class="main__faq-top"><h3>What languages does TrumPick support?</h3><button class="toggle-btn"><img src="./assets/icons/plus.svg" alt="show"></button></div><div class="main__faq-main"><p>The basic and default language is English.
